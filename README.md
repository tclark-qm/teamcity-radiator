teamcity-radiator
=================

This is an update of the radiator described 
<a href='http://soyouthinkyouneedtorewrite.com/diy-build-radiator-for-teamcity/'>here</href>.

This works with the CSS produced by TeamCity 7 and uses masonry to lay the status boxes out nicely.

To deploy copy all of the files here onto a web server and edit the index.html to change the embedded URL to point at your
TeamCity server.

Thanks to Dimitar for fixing all the JavaScript.
